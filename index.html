        <h1>Ivory: a Spatial Story in StoryMap.js</h1>

        <p> Today, the word "ivory" evokes images of a species nearly hunted to extinction, of criminal activity clashing with conservation concerns, of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Before CITES, however, the commodity is associated with the mass production, as it was a raw material in so many coveted European objects like billiard balls and piano keys. And even before this, in the early periods of contact between Europeans and West Africans, ivory was the material of which unique gifts and art were carefully crafted by indigenous African people- while at the same time, these same people were being sold into slavery and valued for the labor they could provide. The following map will focus on this period of early Portuguese trade in West Africa, detailing the journey of "white gold" from its natural state to human hands and the value that it could provide along the way.</p>
        <p><em> The background for this story is a map of West Africa from 1743. The coastal areas and areas next to rivers are described with city or region names, while the interior of the continent is more blank and with more descriptions stating that area is unknown (incognita). In the bottom left corner, an African village is depicted and explained with Latin descriptions. In the village, piles of severed tusks are visible, and African children play on three pieces of ivory that have Italian, French, and German modes of measurement written on them.</em></p>
