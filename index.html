        <h1>Ivory: a Spatial Story in StoryMap.js</h1>

        <p> Today, the word "ivory" evokes images of a species nearly hunted to extinction, of criminal activity clashing with conservation concerns, of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Before CITES, however, the commodity is associated with the mass production, as it was a raw material in so many coveted European objects like billiard balls and piano keys. And even before this, in the early periods of contact between Europeans and West Africans, ivory was the material of which unique gifts and art were carefully crafted by indigenous African people- while at the same time, these same people were being sold into slavery and valued for the labor they could provide. The following map will focus on this period of early Portuguese trade in West Africa, detailing the journey of "white gold" from its natural state to human hands and the value that it could provide along the way.</p>
        <p><em> The background for this story is a map of West Africa from 1743. The coastal areas and areas next to rivers are described with city or region names, while the interior of the continent is more blank and with more descriptions stating that area is unknown (incognita). In the bottom left corner, an African village is depicted and explained with Latin descriptions. In the village, piles of severed tusks are visible, and African children play on three pieces of ivory that have Italian, French, and German modes of measurement written on them.</em></p>

        <p> The results show that I have spent 12771 minutes browsing the internet. The CO2 emissions associated with this usage is equivalent to 226 smartphones and 8.514 kilometers driven by car. About a quarter of those 12771 minutes were spent on Canvas, and another quarter were spent at the David Rumsey Historical Map Collection. However, the accuracy of Carbonalyser, is constrained by memory and technology. Though my own forgetfulness may present CO2 emissions as less than they truly are, I was lucky on the technology front in that this extension did not malfunction and my data was never reset. I believe that during the first few weeks of this course, I forgot to use Firefox and thus I was not collecting data for Carbonalyser. Because of this lapse, I would guess that the graph represents about 7 or 8 weeks of work. 

        <p> When I did start using Carbonalyser, I was shocked at the results. I wondered if I spent an abnormal amount of time on the internet, hoping that my classmates’ minutes would be equally high so that I wouldn't feel as guilty and wasteful. Even after reading from the 
<a href="https://theshiftproject.org/en/carbonalyser-browser-extension/">Carbonalyser website</a>, it is difficult for me to conceptualize what each measurement means (“kWh”, “CO2 emissions”, even, embarrassingly, “kilometers”), but the numbers seem big. This extension has encouraged me to be more mindful about internet usage. I am curious about what number of CO2 emissions constitutes as wasteful ornot, and I am asking myself how I could have cut down my emissions. I stand by the fact that I spent a lot of time on David Rumsey searching for an appropriate map, but whatever sites that are included in “Other” are probably nonessential. I will likely download the app on my phone, a device I use much more frequently than my laptop, and see how the data compare.
