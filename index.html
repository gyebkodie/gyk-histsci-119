        <h1>Ivory: a Spatial Story in StoryMap.js</h1>

        <p> Ivory is an item rarely studied on its own, but this commodity proves useful as a vehicle to observe the context in which it was deemed valuable. In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century, Portuguese merchants held a monopoly over trade in West Africa. They forced themselves into the population of the indigenous people in what is today known as Sierra Leone. There, they traded ivory and commissioned ivories, or pieces crafted from the material. 
The Portuguese appreciated and dutifully shipped these gifts, called ivories, to high-status people in Europe, commenting on the skill of the African carvers. Still, it was indigenous Africans being enslaved and valued for their physical labor, and it was indigenous labor and knowledge practices that produced the ivories  so desired by high-status Europeans. With this is mind, the following map traces the path of travel for a piece of ivory. Ivory's journey from the living animal to human hands highlights the knowledge and skill required for indigenous West Africans to interact with the natural world, and explore how Sapi and Portuguese understood the existence of the other during the period of early contact of the sixteenth century.</p>
        <p><em> The background for this story is a map of West Africa from 1743. The coastal areas and areas next to rivers are described with city or region names, while the interior of the continent is more blank and with more descriptions stating that area is unknown (incognita). In the bottom left corner, an African village is depicted and explained with Latin descriptions. In the village, piles of severed tusks are visible, and African children play on three pieces of ivory that have Italian, French, and German modes of measurement written on them.</em></p>

        <p> The results show that I have spent 12771 minutes browsing the internet. The CO2 emissions associated with this usage is equivalent to 226 smartphones and 8.514 kilometers driven by car. About a quarter of those 12771 minutes were spent on Canvas, and another quarter were spent at the David Rumsey Historical Map Collection. However, the accuracy of Carbonalyser, is constrained by memory and technology. Though my own forgetfulness may present CO2 emissions as less than they truly are, I was lucky on the technology front in that this extension did not malfunction and my data was never reset. I believe that during the first few weeks of this course, I forgot to use Firefox and thus I was not collecting data for Carbonalyser. Because of this lapse, I would guess that the graph represents about 7 or 8 weeks of work. 

        <p> When I did start using Carbonalyser, I was shocked at the results. I wondered if I spent an abnormal amount of time on the internet, hoping that my classmates’ minutes would be equally high so that I wouldn't feel as guilty and wasteful. Even after reading from the 
<a href="https://theshiftproject.org/en/carbonalyser-browser-extension/">Carbonalyser website</a>, it is difficult for me to conceptualize what each measurement means (“kWh”, “CO2 emissions”, even, embarrassingly, “kilometers”), but the numbers seem big. This extension has encouraged me to be more mindful about internet usage. I am curious about what number of CO2 emissions constitutes as wasteful ornot, and I am asking myself how I could have cut down my emissions. I stand by the fact that I spent a lot of time on David Rumsey searching for an appropriate map, but whatever sites that are included in “Other” are probably nonessential. I will likely download the app on my phone, a device I use much more frequently than my laptop, and see how the data compare.
