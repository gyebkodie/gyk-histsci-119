        <h1>Ivory: A Spatial Story in StoryMap.JS</h1>

        <p>Ivory is an item rarely studied on its own, but this commodity proves useful as a vehicle to observe its surroundings during times when it was deemed especially valuable. In the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century, Portuguese merchants traded for ivory, among other natural resources, and commissioned art pieces carved by people from the Sapi region in what is now called Sierra Leone. The Portuguese shipped these pieces, called ivories, to high-status people in Europe. Necessarily, it was indigenous labor and knowledge practices that produced these ivories so desired by high-status Portuguese. With this is mind, the following map traces the path of travel for a piece of ivory in the late fifteenth century. Drawing primarily on secondary sources about “Afro-Portuguese” ivories and about the experiences of Portuguese traders living in West Africa, the map outlines a spatial story that explores ivory beyond its conservationist history. Ivory’s journey from the living animal to human hands highlights the knowledge and skill required for indigenous West Africans to extract things of value from the natural world. Additionally, the journey also explores how the Sapi and Portuguese understood the existence of the other during the period of early contact.</p>
        <p><em> The background for this story is a map of West Africa from 1743. The coastal areas and areas next to rivers are described with city or region names, while the interior of the continent is more blank and with more descriptions stating that area is unknown (incognita). In the bottom left corner, an African village is depicted and explained with Latin descriptions. In the village, piles of severed tusks are visible, and African children play on three pieces of ivory that have Italian, French, and German modes of measurement written on them. The events of this spatial story take place in the region known as "Serra Leoa" to Europeans and to the map's cartographer.</em></p>

        <p>Over the course of this class, I used The Shift Project's Carbonalyser to track the CO2 emissions associated with the class. The results indicate that I had spent 12771 minutes, or approximately 204.5 hours, browsing the internet. The CO2 emissions associated with this usage is equivalent to 226 smartphones and 8.514 kilometers driven by car. About a quarter of those 12771 minutes were spent on Canvas, and another quarter were spent at the David Rumsey Historical Map Collection. However, the accuracy of Carbonalyser is constrained by memory and technology. My own forgetfulness may present CO2 emissions as less than they truly were, and my experiencing a malfunction (of either technology or human error, where the Carbonalyser reset its analysis) means that this screenshot represents only a portion of my emissions for this class. I believe that during the first few weeks of this course, I forgot to use Firefox and thus I was not collecting data for Carbonalyser. Because of this lapse and the reset toward the end of the course, I would guess that the graph represents about 7 or 8 weeks of work.</p>

        <p> When I did start using Carbonalyser, I was shocked at the results. I wondered if I spent an abnormal amount of time on the internet, hoping that my classmates’ minutes would be equally high so that I wouldn't feel as guilty and wasteful. Even after reading from the 
<a href="https://theshiftproject.org/en/carbonalyser-browser-extension/">Carbonalyser website</a>, it is difficult for me to conceptualize what each measurement means (“kWh”, “CO2 emissions”, even, embarrassingly, “kilometers”), but the numbers seem big. This extension has encouraged me to be more mindful about internet usage. I am curious about what number of CO2 emissions constitutes as wasteful or not, and I am asking myself how I could have cut down my emissions, especially as academic work becomes increasingly digitized.</p>

                     <li>The people living in what is now called Sierra Leone did not operate under a king and court system. Instead, chiefs accompanied by elders' counsels ruled over localities in the Sapi region. Still, this stop is on the map is in a Serra Leoa city labelled "Regum",  which is Latin for "Kings". From the time the Europeans first landed in West Africa in the fiteenth century, up through the time of the creation of this map in the mid-eighteenth century, Europeans tended to view West African lifestyle through a royalty based lens, assigning the words king and kingdom when there may have been no equivalent for the Sapi people. This point on the map makes use of the label Regum, but also acknowledges that to consider this the capital city in some kingdom is historically and politically inaccurate.</li>
